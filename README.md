# InsightFlow

## Define Scope & Core Features

**Project Vision:**
Insight Flow aims to create interactive systems that make complex data analysis intuitive for non-experts. The platform focuses on human-centered design, providing accessible, explainable, and collaborative analytics workflows.

**Core Demo Features:**
- Interactive data upload and exploration
- Visualizations of data and model results (charts, graphs, dashboards)
- Simple, guided ML model building (e.g., drag-and-drop or wizard interface)
- Explainability tools (feature importance, SHAP values, decision plots)
- Collaborative workflow (comments, sharing, annotation)
- User-friendly UI/UX with tooltips and onboarding

## Select Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React (Material-UI or Ant Design), D3.js or Plotly for visualizations
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI or Flask) for data processing and ML
- **ML/Explainability:** scikit-learn, SHAP, pandas, numpy
- **Collaboration:** Simple backend storage (SQLite or PostgreSQL), or mock real-time features
- **Deployment:** Docker for local demo, or deploy to Netlify/Vercel (frontend) + Render/Heroku (backend)
